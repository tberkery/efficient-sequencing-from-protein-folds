Final project for Computational Genomics: Sequences

Live goals
1. What are the common folding paths; querying them, counts, etc.?
    a. Find kth order probabilities, build HMM/Viterbi?
    b. Use data structure in (1) to "propose" favorable paths of protein folding
    c. Query folding paths against live sequence
    d. Kinetics of a folding path (number of runs, RSA, etc.)
    d. Sequence of folding paths? Longest common substring?
3. Check "equilibrium" (kth order probabilities remain consistent at different points of simulation).
